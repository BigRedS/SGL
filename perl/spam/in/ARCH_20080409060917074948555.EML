Hi. This is the qmail-send program at smtp0.heteml.jp.
I'm afraid I wasn't able to deliver your message to the following addresses.
This is a permanent error; I've given up. Sorry it didn't work out.

<valle@kumac.com>:
210.188.214.230 does not like recipient.
Remote host said: 511 sorry, no mailbox here by that name (#5.1.1 - chkuser)
Giving up on 210.188.214.230.
