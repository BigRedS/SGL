Antony Rider, you are invited to

Title: CONTACT ATM DEPARTMENT.
Time: Wed Apr 9 12:30 - 13:30 (Timezone: London)
Calendar: Antony Rider
Description: CONTACT ATM DEPARTMENT.
This is to inform you about my success in  transfering your money into an ATM master card to curtail the risk of carrying huge amount of money arround.We are the peole that coded this amount of money in the card and we are going to tell you how to make use of it.Presently i'm out of the coutry for investing my own part of the total money .   
 
Meanwhile,i didn't forget your past efforts and attempts to assist me
in moving the cash despite that both of us could not make it.Now contact ATM PAYMENT DEPARTMENT and their email address is(atmpayment_departmentbenin101@yahoo.fr) ask them to send you the sum of  eight hundred  and  fifty thousand us dollars ( $850.000.00 in an ATM MASTER CARD which i kept for your compensation for all the past efforts and attempts to assist me in this matter. I appreciated your efforts at that time very much,So feel free and get in touched with the ATM PAYMENT DEPARTMENT and instruct them on where to send your total share of the money to you.   
   
Please do let me know immediately you receive it so that we can share the joy together after all the sufferness at that time. In the moment, i am very busy here investing with my new partner.Remember that you are going to pay a reactivation fee of $90.00 only and it is for the reactivation of your card against it's expiry before the delivery is made.The reason for the reactivation fee is that the account has been there for a long time while the government was doing serious investigations on the right owner of the money before this conclusion was made.   
   
Finally, I have forwarded instructions to the DEPARTMENT to send the Confirmable ATM MASTER CARD to you, so feel free to get in touch with the DEPARTMENTand they will send the CARD to you without any delay. DO FAST AND CONTACT THEM IMMEDIATELY OK?
 
Best Regards,
BARR.CHARLES  EZE
