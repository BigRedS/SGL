        <td>Dear Reader,<p>Im writing to tell you about 
        an exciting new program that could put an end to 
        your money worries for good. </p>
        <p><b>I call it the &quot;Global Retirement Fund,&quot; 
        and its an absolute godsend for folks who want 
        a safe, simple way to collect GREAT INCOME -- 
        and also want to GROW THEIR MONEY so that it 
        never runs out.</b></p>
        <p><b><i>Just ask Hank Murdoch...</i> </b></p>
        <p>Hank, 53, lives in Sterling Heights, 
        Michigan, about 10 miles north of Detroit. 
        Hanks life is pretty ordinary. He works a 
        steady 9-to-5, drives a used Ford pick-up truck 
        and helps out at the Local 238 Union office. </p>
        <p>But unlike many of his friends and neighbors, 
        Hank no longer worries about having enough money 
        for retirement. He doesnt have to, thanks to 
        the &quot;Global Retirement Fund.&quot;</p>
        <p><b>In fact, in 2006 alone, Hank used the fund 
        to collect over $285,000 in income.</b></p>
        <p>And get this: He did it without touching one 
        penny of his principal. In fact, while Hank was 
        collecting all that income,<u> his account 
        balance grew by 200%</u> over the last five 
        years.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>Not only has Hank been enjoying an income fit 
        for a king... but hes also been growing his 
        money so that it never runs out.</p>
        <p>And Hank isnt alone when it comes to tapping 
        into the &quot;<b>Global Retirement Fund</b>.&quot; 
        Government records report others are taking 
        advantage of the fund, too: </p>
        <ul>
         <li>Howard Landis of Toledo, Ohio, collected 
         roughly $78,209 in 2007 (quarterly checks of 
         $19,552), compliments of the &quot;Global 
         Retirement Fund.&quot;</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
         <li>Mel Lewis of Tulsa, Oklahoma, collected 
         approximately $141,891 in 2007 (quarterly 
         checks of $35,472), courtesy of the &quot;Global 
         Retirement Fund.&quot;</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
         <li>Chuck Coffey of Toronto, Canada 
         collected about $175,313 in 2007 (quarterly 
         payments of $43,828) from the &quot;Global 
         Retirement Fund.&quot;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>And on October 23, 2007, James Archer of 
        Albany, New York received a <b><u>single-day 
        payout of $93,783</u></b> from the &quot;Global 
        Retirement Fund.&quot; Over the course of 2007, Mr. 
        Sheehan pocketed a phenomenal $375,174 from the 
        same source.</p>

        <b>Now, Perhaps Youre Wondering Whether You <br>
        Should &quot;Enroll&quot; in the Global Retirement Fund?</b></font></p>
        <p>Well, according to Dr. Jeremy Siegel, 
        professor of finance at the Wharton School of 
        Business, the typical American investor should 
        put up to 40% of his equity portfolio in the<b> 
        &quot;Global Retirement Fund</b>.&quot;</p>
        <p><i>The New York Times </i>agrees, saying the 
        fund has &quot;produced spectacular returns.&quot; </p>
        <p>And <i>BusinessWeek</i> concurs, stating that 
        the fund has &quot;delighted American investors.&quot;</p>
        <p>The great thing is, although the &quot;Global 
        Retirement Fund&quot; draws on the massive cash 
        reserves of the worlds wealthiest nations, you 
        can take advantage of it right here in the 
        United States... <u>without sending one dime 
        overseas</u>.</p>
        <p>The Fund is easy to use, and ANYONE can 
        qualify for regular payouts. And that includes 
        YOU -- regardless of your age, occupation, place 
        of residence or income level.</p>
        <p>In fact, by tapping into the &quot;<b>Global 
        Retirement Fund,</b>&quot;<b> you could receive your 
        own payments of $25,000 to $375,000 every year 
        for the rest of your life.</b> How much you can 
        collect depends on your circumstances, as Ill 
        explain in a moment.</p>
        <p>Bottom line: If youre retired, or if youd 
        like to retire soon, or if you simply want a 
        safe, easy way to collect more income AND grow 
        your money... then the &quot;<b>Global Retirement 
        Fund</b>&quot; could be perfect for you.</p>
        <p>In this letter, Ill explain exactly how the 
        &quot;<b>Global Retirement Fund&quot;</b> works. Ill 
        introduce you to the powerful force that is 
        driving the &quot;<b>Global Retirement Fund</b>&quot; and 
        show you why it will only grow stronger over the 
        next decade, handing folks who get in now a 
        whole lotta money.</p>
        <p>Plus, Ill give you all the details and show 
        you exactly how you can sign up to receive your 
        first payout check by April 27, 2008. </p>
        <p>But before I give you the details on how to 
        get started, Id like to show you exactly how 
        the &quot;<b>Global Retirement Fund</b>&quot; works, so 
        you can decide for yourself if its something 
        you might want to try. </p>
        <p>Heres the full story:</p>
        <p align="center">
        <font style="line-height: 1.3em" face="impact" size="6">
        <b>U.S. Markets Rob American <br>
        Investors of Retirement Dreams</b></font></p>
        <p>If you follow the financial news, you know 
        the U.S. markets are in a heap of trouble. </p>
        <p>The cost of living just keeps going through 
        the roof. A dollar doesnt stretch as far as it 
        used to. And with people living a lot longer 
        these days, its easy to see how any of us could 
        run out of money during our golden years.</p>
        <p>In order to keep up, more and more people are 
        venturing into the stock market in search of <u>
        growth and income</u>.&nbsp; </p>
        <p><b>Problem is, the U.S. markets are risky...
        </b></p>
        <p>After all, the dollar is plunging. 
        Unemployment is soaring. And foreclosures are at 
        a record high.</p>
        <p>Factor in $100 oil, the subprime mortgage 
        mess, the sagging real estate market... and 
        youve got the ingredients for a <u>stock market 
        meltdown of historic proportions</u>.</p>
        <p>The downward pressure on the U.S. stock 
        markets is immense.&nbsp; And its going to stay that 
        way for quite a while. People will be lucky to 
        break even... let alone eek out even meager 
        gains.</p>
        <p>Bottom line: Things are going to get a whole 
        lot worse for stocks and bonds before they get 
        better, and if youre pinning your retirement 
        dreams <u>exclusively</u> to U.S. stocks and 
        bonds<font face="Arial"> </font>you are going to 
        experience some severe disappointment.</p>
        <p>Thats why Im so excited about the <b>
        &quot;Global Retirement Fund.&quot;</b>&nbsp; You see, not only 
        does the Fund help protect you against the risky 
        U.S. markets<font face="Arial">,</font> but it 
        can also pay you a lot of extra income and grow 
        your money so that it never runs out.</p>
