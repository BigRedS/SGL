Hello, my dear friend

You know, I never tried to make acquaintances this way. It always seemed
strange to me. But no I realize that I'm so busy with work and other
activities that I just don't have time for personal life. I have many
friends, but it's not enough for happiness. People are happy when they have
Love in their life. It's so nice to see a smile of your beloved person, to
share all that life has to offer, travel and enjoy the world together. I
think that there should be always trust, honesty and understanding between
two beloved people. I want you to become such person for me. I'm interested
to continue correspondence and I will be waiting for your answer. You may
write me to http://buildyourlove.com/7677/


The best of luck
Anastacia
