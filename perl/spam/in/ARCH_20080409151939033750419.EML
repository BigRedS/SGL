At Wachovia we've re-imagined what's possible for online cash =
management. The next step in the transformation of Wachovia Connection =
is access through a new web address (URL). This new URL will allow you =
to access Wachovia Connection and other online services through a single =
sign-on.

All users will be notified and transitioned to the new URL between June =
2007 and October 2008.

Please choose the correct web site from the two options below:

If you have not transitioned to the new URL, or, If you have completed =
the one-time registration process and transitioned to the new URL access =
your login page here:
