Dear Friend, 
 
I am Mr.paul williams ,Employed with a bank here in London,serving in 
Customer Relation Department of the Bank.
 
Mr Davis Dolan,a good friend of mine and a client of this Bank lost 
his life and that of the family in that July 
7th London unforgatable bomb blast. Incidentally before
his death he left a deposit of $25 Million with the bank,which the 
Bank had tried to remit to any of his relation, 
but failed due to inability to trace any of his relatives.
 
Now the bank has issued an ultimatum to have the fund retrieved or it 
will be confiscated. So my aim of writing 
you, is to present you as the next of kin and have the money 
transferred into your account.
I will like to reiterate the urgency of the situation so we need to 
act fast before the bank outruns us.
Please if you are alright with this and you know you are matured 
enough to handle this transaction,get back to me 
as soon as possible so i will direct you on the 
next action to take.
Thank you.

 Mr.paul williams

CRD Officer
