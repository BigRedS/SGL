same last name, so that the proceeds of this account valued at $15Million US
dollars can be paid to you. This will be disbursed or shared in these
percentages, 60% to me and 40% to you. I have the means to provide all
necessary  legal documents that can be used to back up any claim we may make
All I  require is your honest Co-operation, Confidentiality and Trust =20
to enable
us see this transaction through. I guarantee you that this will be executed
under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach =20
of the law.
