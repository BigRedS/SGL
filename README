This is just a backup of my ~/bin directory at work. There's no deliberate organisation here,
really - any semblance is incidental.

Actually, that's a bit of a lie. Some clues by dirnames:

ad	Abortive attempt at automating reports on the contents of our AD. Isn't 
	entirely neccesary and I have other stuff on.
dad	Stuff I wrote for my dad. currently just BT Meridian report munging
dell	Dell warranty status getter. Maybe due for expansion.
kbox	KBox related stuff. Here be SQL
live	Stuff that's in cron jobs and shouldn't be touched.
munin	Munin monitoring scripts
namechanger	batch file renamer
spam	Early drafts of my exchange-spam-archive-sorting script. Real stuff's
	under ./live/spam2
wiki	on-off attempt at a wiki extension for showing ArcServe reports


Some of this works, some of it doesn't, occasionally it's maintained. If you're bored
and want to tell me how I could have done something better, please do.
