Here's where I keep stuff I've written that pertains to the KBox.

Currently it's mostly SQL for reports. The name of the script is 
approximately the same as the report it's used in. It's all c+p'd 
from PHPMyAdmin (where I test them) into here and the KBox. There's 
no automated jiggery pokery going on at the minute.

label.pl was the stand-in until I got the SQL done for per-seat.sql

dumps.pl is my magical SQL dump exporter script which I wrote for
this, but isn't really kbox related.
